## Project Overview

[Product Vision](https://www.notion.so/Community-Calendar-Labs-19-25c4624fa8fe46e49361d73215459050)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/rMUTr0Y5UBkm7AhAVCMrfW/Community-Calendar)

[Planned Releases](https://www.notion.so/06de41bdd6124a459140e0b943b648a1)

Community Calendar is a single web application built with React and styled using SASS and the Bulma framework. Our data is stored and served by an [Apollo GraphQL server](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-be). Mobile versions of the Community Calendar client are under development simultaneously for [Adroid](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/community-calendar-ios).

Community Calendar uses the apollo-client library to conduct GraphQL queries and store data in local cache for state management purposes. Authentication of users is accomplished through the Auth0 API.

### Environment Variables

Create a file for environment variables: `.env` .

#### Required env variables:

- REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN
- REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
- REACT_APP_AUTH0_API_AUDIENCE
- REACT_APP_APOLLO_SERVER
- REACT_APP_MAPBOX

### For developing in VS Code

Install the ESLint extension: [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension. Add the following configuration parameters to VS Code settings.json:

```
{
  "prettier.requireConfig": true
}
```

## Styling

This project use Sass for stying. The Bulma library was incorporated to speed up development.

Webpack will convert kabob-case class names in modules to camelCase.

So '.best-class-ever' in App.module.scss must be used in App.jsx as '.bestClassEver'.

Kabob-case class names are not altered for classes created in non-module style sheets.

`src/styles/` - contains classes, mixins, and variables that are used throughout the application.

`src/styles/_variables.scss` - contains variables such as colors, padding, and border radius that can be used within classes and mixins. To override a Bulma variable add a variable with the same name to this file. To use the variables in a component module this file file must be imported.

`src/styles/_mixins.scss` - styles that can be added to classes with `@include mixin_name`. To use the variables in a component module this file file must be imported.

`src/styles/_helper_classes.scss` - utility classes created by the CC devs. These classes are available globally.

`src/styles/_bulma_overrides.scss` - this is used to override the implementation of classes from Bulma. The class will retain any styles that are not altered in this file.

`src/components/**/*.module.scss` - contains styles for a component or group of components.

## Testing

Jest is use for snapshot, unit, and integration tests.

The Testing-Library/React library is used to help test React components. It includes many utilities that simplify setting up and testing React components. '@testing-library/jest-dom' provides additional assertion methods. '@testing-library/user-event' has utilities for simulating user events such as clicking on a button.

## Future Developers

There are a few key considerations for the development team inheriting development of this application:

### Custom Webpack

[Westley Strellis](https://github.com/wstrellis) rolled a custom webpack for this project. If you are used to developing with `Create-React-App`, there are few nuances to how styles are imported and built. If you follow the file naming conventions in the [Styling](#styling) section development is straightforward. You can contact Westley by slack, github, or email with any questions.

### State Management

[Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) is a complete state management library for React apps that use GraphQL. The `@apollo/react-hooks` library's tools for conducting GraphQL queries and mutations and storing fetched results from the network in a local cache are excellent. You never need to put the results of your `useQuery` hooks or other network requests into local state, because the Apollo Client automatically does that in their cache. Future queries qith `readQuery` will pull data from the local cache first, or will go back to the network if needed.

However, Apollo Client's tools for local state management through the `useApolloClient()` hook at `cache.writeData` method are much more limited. They are billed as a replacement for Redux, but actually leave a lot to be desired. The Apollo Client local state features are [documented here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/local-state/) and are also demonstrated in their [tutorial here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/local-state/). Our recommendation to future developers is to implement a Redux store alongside the Apollo Client for storing local state (user location, preferences, etc).

There are several other dependencies that use of Apollo Client brought in to our project, including `apollo-cache-inmemory`, `apollo-client`, `apollo-link`, `apollo-link-context`, `apollo-link-error`, `apollo-link-http`, and `apollo-upload-client`. To get familiar with the Apollo stack we recommend doing their [entire official tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial) to help understand how these pieces work together.

### Forms

[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) was our library of choice for managing form state and validation. It works alongside [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) in a similar fashion to Formik, but give you some more flexibility and control over your submitter, handler, and error methods.

### Media Upload

[apollo-upload-client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client) and [react-dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) are used together to accomplish media upload by embedding image files in GraphQL mutation requests. The image files are resolved on the backend, where the files are uploaded to a hosting service with the URL stored in the database.
